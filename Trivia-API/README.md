## Trivia API

The Trivia API application allows for:

1) Adding and deleting questions.
2) Displaying the existing questions - all questions and questions by category.
4) Searching for questions based on a text query string.
5) Playing the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or questions within a specific category. 

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a **Flask** server with a **SQLAlchemy** module to simplify the data needs.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a **React** frontend to consume the data from the **Flask** server.
